# MindMatters-FrontEnd
This Android project is the frontend component of our app MindMatters.

Mind Matters is a mental health mobile application that aims to help people who want to access mental health resources. It first will require the users to take a mental health quiz so that we can better understand their needs, before running the outcomes and generating a list of recommended practices for the users based on their needs. Mind Matters also provides a quick list of get-help contact details so that users can quickly access the helplines if desired. 

Please ensure you download and set up all three projects to run the application:

2.	Spring Boot Back End Project - https://github.com/EswaranRajagopalan/MindMatters-BackEnd.git
